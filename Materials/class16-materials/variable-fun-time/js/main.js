//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let age = 1
//minus 10 from that number
age = age - 10
//print that number to the console
console.log(age)
//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let age2 = 10
//add 25 to that number
age2 = age2 + 10
//alert that number
alert(age2)
//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1
let hold = document.querySelector('#h1')
//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
hold = addEventListener
